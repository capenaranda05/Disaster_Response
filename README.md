## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All libraries are available in Anaconda distribution of Python. The used libraries are:

- sys
- numpy 
- pandas 
- sqlalchemy 
- nltk
- re
- sklearn
- pickle
- Flask
- plotly
- sqlite3


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The principal goal of the project is to classify disaster messages into categories. For this project, disaster data from Figure Eight was analyzed to build a multiple disaster message classification model for an API. From a web application, the user can enter a message and obtain classification results in various categories. The latter also presents a visualization of the model results.


## Project Descriptions<a name = "descriptions"></a>
The project has three componants which are:

1. **ETL Pipeline:** `process_data.py` file contain the script to create ETL pipline which:

- Loads the `messages` and `categories` datasets
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a SQLite database

2. **ML Pipeline:** `train_classifier.py` file contain the script to create ML pipline which:

- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

3. **Flask Web App:** the web app enables the user to enter a disaster message, and then view the categories of the message.

The web app also contains some visualizations that describe the data. 
 
 
 
## Files Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`
        

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`
